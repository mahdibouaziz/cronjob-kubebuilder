		The reconciler fetches all jobs owned by the cronjob for the status. As our number of cronjobs increases,
		looking these up can become quite slow as we have to filter through all of them. For a more efficient lookup,
		these jobs will be indexed locally on the controller's name. A jobOwnerKey field is added to the

		of the world, so it's generally not a good idea to read from the status of the
		root object.  Instead, you should reconstruct it every run.  That's what we'll
		do here.

		We can check if a job is "finished" and whether it succeeded or failed using status
